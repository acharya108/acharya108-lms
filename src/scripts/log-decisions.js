      description: "Critical lesson from header component breakdown and recovery",
      decision: "Always restore from backup first when components break, rather than attempting complete rewrites",
      rationale: "Working code with minor issues is better than broken 'perfect' code. Backup restoration is faster, lower risk, and preserves existing styling and functionality.",
      alternativesConsidered: [
        "Continue rewriting broken components (high risk, time-consuming)",
        "Try multiple fix attempts without backup (led to complete style loss)",

    await captureNewDecision({
      title: "Incremental Component Updates with Git Commits",
      description: "Process for safely updating React components", 
      decision: "Make incremental changes with Git commits at each stable point. Never overhaul working components in one go.",
      rationale: "Preserves ability to backtrack. Each small change can be tested and reverted if needed. Prevents complete component breakdown.",
      alternativesConsidered: [
        "Major refactors without commits (high risk)",
        "Overhaul styling and functionality simultaneously (breaks everything)",
        "No version control (unrecoverable errors)"
