‚Ä¢ Admin layout component with sidebar navigation
‚Ä¢ Basic routing structure for admin sections  
‚Ä¢ Shadcn/UI component library integration
‚Ä¢ TanStack Query setup for data fetching
‚Ä¢ Basic admin dashboard

PHASE 2: CONTENT MANAGEMENT CORE

‚Ä¢ Course/Subject/Lesson hierarchy management
‚Ä¢ React Hook Form integration with validation
‚Ä¢ Basic media upload interface

PHASE 3: RICH CONTENT EDITOR
‚Ä¢ 5-level lesson content editor (Foundation ‚Üí Expert)
‚Ä¢ Advanced media management (videos, images, animations)
‚Ä¢ Formula and definition card creator
‚Ä¢ Assessment question builder (MCQ & Descriptive)
‚Ä¢ Content versioning and cloning interface

PHASE 4: ADVANCED FEATURES
‚Ä¢ Bulk content operations
‚Ä¢ Content analytics and reporting
‚Ä¢ User role management for content teams
‚Ä¢ AI-assisted content suggestions`,
