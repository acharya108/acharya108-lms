      decision: "Implement TanStack Query (React Query) for all server state management including courses, lessons, user progress, and assessments",
      rationale: `1. Excellent caching and background updates
2. Automatic error handling and retries
3. Great for educational content that needs frequent updates
4. Reduces boilerplate code significantly
5. Perfect for real-time progress tracking`,
      alternativesConsidered: [
        "SWR - Simpler but lacks advanced features like mutations and pagination",
        "RTK Query - Tied to Redux ecosystem, heavier bundle",
        "Apollo Client - GraphQL focused, overkill for REST",
        "Custom hooks - Maintenance burden, inconsistent patterns",
        "Axios + useState - No caching, manual loading states"
