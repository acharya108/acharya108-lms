    await captureNewDecision({
      title: "Standardized Course Taxonomy Structure",
      description: "Decision about how to organize courses, categories, and sub-categories",
      decision: "Implement Categories ‚Üí Sub-Categories ‚Üí Courses ‚Üí Subjects ‚Üí Lessons hierarchy with Excel-matching course IDs (STTNE6, STTNE10, etc.)",
      rationale: "Matches existing Excel structure, provides clear navigation path, scalable for 100+ courses",
      alternativesConsidered: [
        "Flat course list (poor organization)",
        "Per-course files (unmaintainable at scale)",
        "Different ID patterns (breaks Excel compatibility)"

    await captureNewDecision({
      title: "Single Dynamic Course Content Component",
      description: "Decision about how to handle course content display",
      decision: "Use single CourseContentPage.jsx that dynamically handles ALL courses based on URL parameter (:courseId)",
      rationale: "Scalable approach prevents file explosion, consistent user experience, maintainable codebase",
      alternativesConsidered: [
        "Per-course component files (100+ files unmanageable)",
        "Course family components (still too many files)",
        "If-else routing logic (complex and fragile)"
      ],
      category: "architecture", 
      impact: "high"
    })

    // DECISION 3: Database-Driven Hybrid Approach
    await captureNewDecision({
      title: "Database-Driven Hybrid Data Strategy",
      description: "Decision about course content storage and retrieval",
      decision: "Implement hybrid approach: API/database first ‚Üí static fallback data for development",
      rationale: "Balances development speed with production scalability, provides offline capability, progressive enhancement",
      alternativesConsidered: [
        "Pure static data (limited scalability)",
        "Pure database (development complexity)",
        "File-based per course (maintenance nightmare)"
      ],
      category: "data",
      impact: "high"
    })

    // DECISION 4: Consistent Header Visibility
    await captureNewDecision({
      title: "Consistent Header Across All Pages",
      description: "Decision about header visibility and layout consistency",
      decision: "Show header on ALL pages including home page, remove conditional header hiding",
      rationale: "Better navigation consistency, professional appearance, avoids user confusion",
      alternativesConsidered: [
        "Header only on non-home pages (broken navigation flow)",
        "Different headers per page type (inconsistent branding)",
        "Conditional header based on scroll (complex implementation)"
      ],
      category: "ui",
      impact: "medium"
    })

    // DECISION 5: Course ID Naming Convention
    await captureNewDecision({
      title: "Strict Course ID Naming Convention",
      description: "Decision about course ID format and consistency",
      decision: "Use exact Excel course IDs without modifications (STTNE6 not STTNE6.0, RETPE1 not Rectt1)",
      rationale: "Maintains data integrity, prevents mapping errors, ensures Excel compatibility",
      alternativesConsidered: [
        "Modified IDs for readability (breaks data consistency)",
        "Auto-generated IDs (loses Excel mapping)",
        "Versioned IDs (unnecessary complexity)"
      ],
